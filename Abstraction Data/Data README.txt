The files in this folder contain the abstraction results for various control systems:
HWC = intelligent headway controller
Steering = active steering control system
Susp = active suspension control system

The abstraction are done for different values of m using both the Q method and the E method (except for the suspesion system, since it is 
four-dimensional the E mehtod cannot be applied).
